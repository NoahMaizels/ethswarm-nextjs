        Swarm is a system of peer-to-peer networked nodes for a decentralised storage and communication service.

        Swarm could shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. On Swarm, applications run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.

        [Fairdrive protocol](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/FIPs/blob/master/text/0001-fdp-roadmap.md "Fairdrive protocol") aims to be a set of specifications and reference implementations with 6 milestones. The first 5 are about creating a web3 ecosystem and utilizing the potential of Ethereum Swarm. The last planned step is about tackling integrations with other P2P and web3 systems.
