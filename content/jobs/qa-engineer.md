Swarm is a system of peer-to-peer networked nodes for a decentralized storage and communication service. 

Swarm could shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. On Swarm, applications run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.

Bee is a Swarm client implemented in Go. It’s the basic building block for the Swarm Network. 

Bee provides low level constructs for file storage, feeds, key-value stores and untraceable communication, through solid, well-tested code delivered in an agile manner.

Key technologies are Go, libp2p, protobuf, leveldb, and go-ethereum, as well as various cryptographic libraries.
