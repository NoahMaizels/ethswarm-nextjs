        Swarm is a system of peer-to-peer networked nodes for a decentralised storage and communication service.

        Swarm could shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. On Swarm, applications run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.
