    copy:
      In January, the Bee Track released a new version of the Bee client (1.11)
      that brings an important update to uploads with mutable batches. This update causes
      newer chunks in a batch to replace older ones on the network. The Research Track,
      on the other hand, is nearing completion of Phase 3 of the storage incentives
      and is making great progress in producing documentation for Phases 4 and 5.
