      Bee 1.17 is here! This update represents a significant step forward in
      terms of increased ease of code maintainability and reduced time for new
      feature development. With the storage incentives rollout nearing
      completion, the team has in recent months focused on the completion of the
      1.17 update.

      In the past month, the Swarm ecosystem has seen some significant
      developments. The Bee Track team released the much anticipated localstore
      rewrite and has already ironed out some of the notable issues in version
      1.17.3. Meanwhile, anticipation builds for the release of Phase 4 items
      and the price oracle, both set to further enhance the storage incentive
      system.
