    An economically self-sustaining mechanism to gather storage operators.

    Historically, people had two choices when it came to hosting their data: they could either store it themselves or upload it to a trusted third party computer. Regarding the latter, the source of this trust is typically that the host — usually a corporation — is conducting a long term business requiring them to be reliable and reputable. On the other hand, self-hosting requires that one’s computer is online at all times, which is often not feasible.

  copy: In January, the Bee Track released a new version of the Bee client (1.11)
    that brings an important update to uploads with mutable batches. This update causes
    newer chunks in a batch to replace older ones on the network. The Research Track,
    on the other hand, is nearing completion of Phase 3 of the storage incentives
    and is making great progress in producing documentation for Phases 4 and 5.
