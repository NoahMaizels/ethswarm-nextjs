            Swarm Improvement Proposals (SWIPs) describe standards for the Swarm platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. Interested parties can follow the the SWIP process to submit their specification proposals on said topics. It is best to first test the ideas for proposals with the rest of the Swarm community on the [Swarm Discord](https://discord.ethswarm.org) channels, followed up by formalising them in the [SWIP repository](https://github.com/ethersphere/SWIPs/).

            More information can be found in the [SWIP readme](https://github.com/ethersphere/SWIPs#readme). A browsable version of all current and draft SWIPs can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ethersphere/SWIPs/tree/master/SWIPs).
