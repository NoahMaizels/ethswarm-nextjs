            * Setting up a node (including crypto-onboarding) on Mac, Windows and Linux can be done in under 30' in >70% of the cases (both mainnet and testnet)

            * User funds are reasonably secure and this is guaranteed by an audit

            * There are multiple documented ways of monitoring and interacting with a Bee node

            * Setting up a Bee-Gateway is documented and easy to set up

            If it is trivial to set up a Bee node, more of them will be set up, which will result in a stronger network. More people will be able to publish and access content (Milestone #1). Through the gateway set-up, developers and communities can easily access the Swarm network.
