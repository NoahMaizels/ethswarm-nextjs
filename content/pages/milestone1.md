            Uploading and downloading content such as websites or nft-metadata is
            optimised and predictable. This functionality can be accessed through
            all Swarm products:

            * Bee

            * Gateway

            * Swarm-CLI

            * Google Chrome extension

            * Dashboard

            * Bee-js

            * Small amounts of data and dApps (\~5MB) can be uploaded and downloaded reliably

            * Websites can be accessed by means of a human-readable name without the
            need for completing a blockchain transaction for every update

            With this goal achieved, Swarm further unlocks the following features:


            * Permissionless upload and download

            * Robust defences against blocking or changing access to content once
            published

            * Auto-scaling with increased demand

            * Integrity protected content

            * Eventually forgetting content that is no longer relevant to preserve
