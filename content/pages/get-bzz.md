                title: Is the token supply deflationary like Bitcoin?
                content:
                  The token supply is not fixed and can increase or decrease via
                  the bonding curve. Put simply, if the supply goes up by one token, so
                  does its price in the bonding curve contract, and vice versa. This makes
                  BZZ neither inflationary nor deflationary. You can read about Swarm’s
                  supply and bonding curve in detail [here](https://medium.com/ethereum-swarm/swarm-and-its-bzzaar-bonding-curve-ac2fa9889914).

                title: Will I receive BZZ if I run a full node?
                content:
                  The storage incentives system compensates storage providers through
                  a redistribution mechanism, depending on the amount of BZZ tokens they
                  stake, and whether or not they are selected for redistribution. Read more

          title: Disclaimer
          content: BZZ utility token should not be purchased for financial gain or speculation. There are risks related with holding and using BZZ token and other cryptocurrency, staking and participating in the network as a node operator. The node may not receive any reward at all, amounts staked may be unexpectedly slashed, uploaded data may become unavailable or corrupt, temporarily or permanently lost depending on the performance of the network during these phases. Only by participating actively in the network, its parameters can be tested and patched when needed. An external audit on the upgrades will be conducted in parallel with the estimated delivery date being March 2023. All dates and information in this page is indicative and may change without prior warning. Follow us on discord and twitter for updates.
